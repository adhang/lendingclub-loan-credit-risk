# LendingClub - Loan Credit Risk Prediction

This is my internship project as a data scientist at [id/x partners](https://idxpartners.com/)
<br><br>

In this project, I designed a predictive model to determine the probability that loan borrowers will have a good or bad (risky) loan status at a lending company.
