# LendingClub - Loan Credit Risk Prediction

This is my internship project as a data scientist at [id/x partners](https://idxpartners.com/)
<br><br>

In this project, I used the gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost and LightGBM) to determine the probability of a borrowerâ€™s default risk in a lending company and achieved a 98% accuracy score
